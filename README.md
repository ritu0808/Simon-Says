Simon says is a mini project which i build when i was learning DOM 

#Description 
It is a simple memory-based game,when we start it by clicking on start button ,randomly one box out of four will flash and we have to memorise it and click on that box which browser flashes 
if we click on right box we will be forwarded to next level, if we don't we are back to level one,and after clicking on right one a box will flash again, it can be old or new then we have to click 
from the color which flashes first and then follow the browser's color flashing pattern one by one,by following browser pattern we can go to next level otherwise we will back to level one
